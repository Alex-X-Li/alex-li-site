# Alex Li Retro Desktop

A Windows 98–inspired personal homepage built with static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site recreates a retro desktop experience featuring draggable, resizable windows, themed icons, and a small, self-hosted "Internet Explorer" landing page linking to Alex Li's online profiles.
